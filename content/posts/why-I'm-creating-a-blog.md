### Why I'm starting a blog

Like anyone that has a blog, or creates creates online content, I'm starting this because I think I have something unique to say &mdash;
That might not necessarily be true, but there's no way of knowing right now(or at least I can't think of a way). I'm also starting this because
I want to document my life, even though I'm not going to writing an autobiography every posts, through these posts I&mdash;and that whoever reads
this&mdash;will be able to map out my perspective through time. I also don't want to make this blog too narcissistic, I want to provide content that will
provide real value for other people, so I will be rarely, if ever, talking directly about myself.

### What I will be writing about

I will be writing about whatever is of interest to me at the moment.
I feel like technical people tend to shy away from topics that don't have to do with their field, and I do too, but life is bigger then technology and everything
is interconnected, so it's impossible to talk about technology without talking about everything else. I will talk heavily about projects I'm working on, or
cool hacks I found, but I will also incorporate books I've read, interesting life lessons, etc.

### Who am I

I am a human. A sometimes rational creature that is able to manipulate the world and create new things.
