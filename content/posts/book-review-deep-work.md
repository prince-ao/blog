## Quick Summary

The book revolves around the concept of "Deep Work", which Newport defines as "Professional activies performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push
your cognitive capabilities to their limits." In the books he argues that Deep Work is valuable skill for [knowledge workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker). He then goes into the several ways to increase deep work along with supporting evidence for those methods. And finally, he concludes with how
deep work positivly impacted his life.

## Review

This is the second time reading Deep Work, and this time around I got more of a sense of where this book went wrong. All the reviews I've read either criticized
the idea of deep work or the writing of the book or both. Newport did a good job in addressing all the criticisms of the idea of deep work itself, all the arguments
against deep work were either directly or indirectly addressed in the book; what I agree with is the critique on the format of the book. In the book, Newport used the
classic pop-science/motivational book motif of jumping from one story to another to support their claim(and make the book longer); that style of writing is not
necessarily bad(if done well), and Deep Work does not claim to be anything more than a pop-science/motivational book, but it is a bit hypocritical to write a shallow
book about deep work. This is stated well by one Goodreads review, ["This book is mostly random commentary on other people's work and content. Almost nothing is original and no studies have been conducted by the author himself. The author's contribution is simply - this researcher found this, I do it this way and you should do it too. The irony of this book is that the subject matter expert on deep work has produced such shallow content."](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1971653061?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1). If this was any other motivational book I would give it 5 stars because you should know what your getting into when
you pick up one of those books, and Deep Work did well at being that kind of book, but because its subtle hypocrisy, I will have to give it 4 stars.

## Should You Read It

This book is very short < 200 pages, so it wouldn't hurt to read it, the question is whether you will gain anything. If you're a person that is constantly in a state of
distraction I think this book is a good start to rethinking your habits, but if you're a focus/motivated person, then this book is pointless, just do some research on
how to increase productivity.
