  <b>What is it?</b>

  YASC is a simple operator precedence calculator. It is able to do addition, subtraction,
  multiplication and division(and potentially other mathematical operations in the future) 
  based on the operators precedence.

  <b>Why?</b>
<ul><li>My real goal is to create a compiler, and parsing is an important part of
compiler design, so this project help me get a step closer to my goal.</li>
<li>I recently fell in love Typescript and I wanted to test the limits of its type system(There are limits, sort of).</li></ul>
  
  <b>Challenges</b>
  Building the UI was very simple. Building the parser was the challenge, more specifically, dealing with
  undefined and null types. Returning from functions was difficult because I couldn't use the return keyword
  because that would lead to the function being defined as a null or undefined type. I finally figured out
  that you can exit out of a function using the exit function and that wont effect the type of the function;
  that trick brought parsing from nearly impossible to simple.

  <b>Main Takeaways</b>
	<ul><li>Pratt parsing is the best method of parsing. At least on a small scale.</li>
	<li>If anybody from typescript is reading, you should add a way to initialize objects to default values without typing everything.</li>
	<li>Use the exit function to exit a function without affecting it's type.</li></ul>
